This spreadsheet is developed for calculating Ackermann steering geometry for RC-cars.

Installing
----------

Easy! Downolad and open in LibreOffice Calc. You had to enable macros in security settings, else the spinboxes won't work.

Usage & Getting help
--------------------

Sorry, no support. But the spreadsheet should be quite intuitive. If you have any questions, suggestions, bug reports or improvements, mail me at jonas@ekhorva.se . Good luck in your design!
